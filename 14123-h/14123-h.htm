    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h4>No. VII.&mdash;TO VANITY.</h4>

    <p>DEAR VANITY,</p>

    <p>Imagine my feelings when I read the following letter. It lay
    quite innocently on my breakfast-table in a heap of others. It
    was stamped in the ordinary way, post-marked in the ordinary
    way, and addressed correctly, though how the charming writer
    discovered my address I cannot undertake to say; in fact, there
    was nothing in its outward appearance to distinguish it from
    the rest of my everyday correspondence. I opened it carelessly,
    and this is what I read:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:40%;">
        <a href="images/253.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/253.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>RIDICULOUS BEING,&mdash;In the course of a fairly short life
    I have read many absurd things, but never in all my existence
    have I read anything so absurd as your last letter. I don't say
    that your amiable story about HERMIONE MAYBLOOM is not
    absolutely true; in fact, I knew HERMIONE <i>very slightly</i>
    myself when everybody was raving about her, and I never
    <i>could</i> understand what all you men (for, of course, you
    are a man; no woman could be so foolish) saw in her to make you
    lose your preposterous heads. To me she always seemed
    <i>silly</i> and <i>affected</i>, and <i>not in the least</i>
    pretty, with her snub nose, and her fuzzy hair. So I am rather
    glad, not from any personal motive, but for the sake of
    <i>truth</i> and <i>justice</i>, that you have shown her up.
    No; what I do complain of is, your evident intention to make
    the world believe that only women are vain. You pretend to
    lecture us about our shortcomings, and you don't seem to know
    that there is no vainer creature in existence than a man. No
    peacock that ever strutted with an expanded tail is one-half so
    ridiculous or silly as a man. I make no
    distinctions&mdash;<i>all men are the same</i>; at least,
    that's my experience, and that of every woman I ever met.</p>

    <p>How do you suppose a woman like HERMIONE succeeds as she
    does? Why she finds out (it doesn't take long, I assure you)
    the weak points of the men she meets; their wretched
    jealousies, affectations and conceits, and then artfully
    proceeds to flatter them and make each of them think his
    particular self the lord of creation, until she has all the
    weak and foolish creatures wound round her little finger, and
    slavishly ready to fetch and carry for her. And all the time
    you go about and boast of your conquest to one another, and
    imagine that <i>you</i> have subjugated her. But she sits at
    home and laughs at you, and <i>despises</i> you all from the
    flinty bottom of her heart. Bah! you're a pack of fools, and
    I've no patience with you. As for you personally, if you
    <i>must</i> write any more, tell your fellow men something
    about their own follies. It won't be news to <i>us</i>, but it
    may open <i>their</i> eyes. If you can't do that, you had
    better retire into your tub, and cease your painful barking
    altogether. I've got my eye on you, so be careful. I remain
    (thank goodness)</p>

    <p class="author">A WOMAN.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Now that was not altogether an agreeable breakfast dish. And
    the worst of it was that it was so supremely unjustifiable. Had
    my indignant correspondent honoured me with her address, I
    should have answered her at once. "Madam," I should have said,
    "your anger outstrips your reason. I always intended to say
    something about men. I had already begun a second letter to my
    friend VANITY on the subject. I can therefore afford to forgive
    your hard words, and to admit that there is a certain amount of
    truth in your strictures on us. But please don't write to me
    again so furiously. Such excessive annoyance is quite out of
    keeping with your pretty handwriting, and besides, it takes
    away my appetite to think I have even involuntarily given you
    pain. Be kind enough to look out for my next letter, but don't,
    for goodness' sake, tell me what you think about it, unless it
    should happen to please you. In that case I shall, of course,
    be proud and glad to hear from you again."</p>

    <p>I now proceed, therefore, to carry out my intention, and, as
    usual, I address myself to the fountain head. My dear VANITY, I
    never shall understand why you take so much trouble to get hold
    of men. They are not a pleasing sight when you have got them,
    and after a time it must cease to amuse even you to see
    yourself reproduced over and over again, and in innumerable
    ridiculous ways. For instance, there is Dr. PEAGAM, the
    celebrated author of <i>Indo-Hebraic Fairy Tales: a new Theory
    of their Rise and Development, with an Excursus on an Early
    Aryan Version of</i> "<i>Three Blind Mice</i>." Dr. PEAGAM is
    learned; he has the industry of a beaver; he is a correspondent
    of goodness knows how many foreign philosophical, philological,
    and mythological societies; his record of University
    distinctions has never been equalled; his advice has been
    sought by German Professors. Yet he carries all this weight of
    celebrity and learning as lightly as if it were a wideawake,
    and seems to think nothing of it. But he has his weak point,
    and, like Achilles, he has it in his feet.</p>

    <p>This veteran investigator, this hoary and venerable Doctor,
    would cheerfully give years off his life if only the various
    philosophers who from time to time sit at his feet would
    recognise that those feet are small, and compliment him on the
    fact. They <i>are</i> small, there is no doubt of it, but not
    small enough to be encased without agony in the tiny, natty,
    pointed boots that he habitually wears. Let anybody who wants
    to get anything out of Dr. PEAGAM lead the conversation
    craftily on to the subject of feet and their proper size. Let
    him then make the discovery (aloud) that the Doctor's feet are
    extraordinarily small and beautiful, and I warrant that there
    is nothing the Doctor can bestow which shall not be freely
    offered to this cunning flatterer. That is why Dr. PEAGAM, a
    modest man in most respects, always insists on sitting in the
    front row on any platform, and ostentatiously dusts his boots
    with a red silk pocket-handkerchief.</p>

    <p>Then, again, who is there that has not heard of
    Major-General WHACKLEY, V.C., the hero who captured the
    ferocious Ameer of Mudwallah single-handed, and carried him on
    his back to the English camp&mdash;the man to whose dauntless
    courage, above all others, the marvellous victory of Pilferabad
    was due? Speak to him on military matters, and you will find
    the old warrior as shy as a school-girl; but only mention the
    word poetry, and you'll have him reciting his ballads and odes
    to you by the dozen, and declaiming for hours together about
    the obtuseness of the publishing fraternity.</p>

    <p>I don't speak now of literary men who value themselves above
    LAMB, DICKENS, and THACKERAY, rolled into one; nor of artists
    who sneer at TITIAN; nor of actors who hold GARRICK to be
    absurdly overrated. Space would fail me, and patience you. But
    let me just for a brief moment call to your mind ROLAND
    PRETTYMAN. Upon my soul, I think ROLAND the most empty-headed
    fribble, the most affected coxcomb, and the most conceited
    noodle in the whole world. He was decently good-looking once,
    and he had a pretty knack of sketching in water-colours.</p>

    <p>But oh, the huge, distorted, overweening conceit of the man!
    I have seen him lying full length on a couch, waving a scented
    handkerchief amongst a crowd of submissive women, who were
    grovelling round him, while he enlarged in his own pet jargon
    on the surpassing merits of his latest unpublished essay, or
    pointed out the beauties of the trifling pictures which were
    the products of his ineffective brush. He will never accomplish
    anything, and yet to the end of his life, I fancy, he will have
    his circle of toadies and flatterers who will pretend to accept
    him as the evangelist of a glorious literary and artistic
    gospel. For unfortunately he is as rich as he is impudent and
    incompetent. And when he drives out in a Hansom he never ceases
    to simper at his reflected image in the little corner
    looking-glasses, by means of which modern cab-proprietors
    pander to the weakness of men. Such is your handiwork, my
    excellent VANITY. Are you proud of it?</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, &amp;c.,<br />
    DIOGENES ROBINSON.</p>

    <h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

    <p>"ONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW EVERYTHING."&mdash;You ask, What are
    the duties of "the Ranger"? Household duties only. He has to
    inspect the kitchen-ranges in the kitchens of Buckingham
    Palace, Windsor Castle, Balmoral, and Osborne. Hence the style
    and title. He also edits Cook's Guides.</p>

    <p>"ANOTHER IDIOT" wishes to know if there is such an
    appointment in the gift of the Crown as the office of "Court
    Sweep." Why, certainly; and, on State occasions, he wears the
    Court Soot, and his broom is always waiting for him at the
    entrance! At Balmoral and Osborne there is a beautiful sweep
    leading the visitor right up to the front door.</p>

    <p>"ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE" writes us,&mdash;"Sir, in what poem
    of MILTON's does the following couplet occur?&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>How are the lines to be scanned?" <i>Ans.</i>&mdash;On
    internal evidence, we question whether the lines are MILTON's.
    In the absence of our Poet, who is out for a holiday, we can
    only reply, that if shortsighted, you can scan them by the aid
    of a powerful glass&mdash;of your favourite compound.</p>

    <h2>ALL BERRY WELL.</h2>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;As there is so much talk just now about the best
    way in which to make Coffee, I will mention the plan I adopt,
    in the hope that some of your readers may imitate it in their
    own homes. It is very simple. You take some of the excellent
    "Coffee Mixture," sold by the "Arabo-Egyptian Pure Parisian
    Berry Company, Limited," at sixpence the pound. You need not
    give more than one tea-spoon to every four persons, as the
    coffee is very good and thick. Add condensed milk, and fill
    with water, after which, let the pot stand on the hob an hour
    before use. You would be surprised at the quality of the fluid
    which results. It gives general satisfaction in my own circle.
    My nephew, who lives with me, declares that it is the only
    genuine coffee he has drunk since he returned from the East. He
    usually, however, has his breakfast out. My General Servant
    says that "she prefers it to beer" (though she takes both), and
    has asked me for some to send to an Aunt of hers with whom she
    has quarrelled. I think this very nice and forgiving of her,
    and have allowed her a quarter of a pound for that purpose. My
    son-in-law, who unfortunately is rather addicted to drink, says
    it is "the finest tap he ever tasted," and adds that if he
    could be sure of always having such Coffee, he would join the
    Blue Ribbon Army at once. Hitherto he has not joined.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours humbly,<br />
    MARTHA HUSWIFE.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;At my "Home for Elderly Orphans of Defective
    Brain Power," I give an <i>excellent</i> Coffee, made of five
    parts chicory, and one of Mocha, supplied at a cheap rate by a
    House in the City, which owes me money, and is paying it off in
    this way, with skim-milk added, in moderation, and no sugar.
    None of the orphans has ever complained of my Coffee. I should
    like to catch them doing so. It is nonsense to say the art of
    coffee-making is unknown in England.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours, indignantly,<br />
    CLEOPATRA JONES.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;Here is the recipe for Coffee which we use at
    this Buffet:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Place one pound of the 'Nonpareil Turkish Pasha's Special
    Brand Extract of finest Mocha' in the urn in the morning. Pour
    on boiling water to half-way up. Let it stew all day. Draw off
    as wanted, and dilute with 'Anglo-African Condensed Cows'
    Milk.'"</p>

    <p>Strange to say, we do not find great demand either for
    Coffee or Tea (made on similar principles); but it is as well
    that the Public should know that we have both in constant
    readiness, and of first-class quality. The traveller who has
    drunk a cup of this Coffee in conjunction with one of our
    celebrated Home-made Pork Pies, does not require anything else
    till the end of the very longest journey, and, probably, not
    even then.</p>

    <p>THE GEORGIAN ERA AT THE ALHAMBRA.&mdash;Mrs. ABBOTT is an
    electric wonder. Not strong muscularly, but with sufficient
    electric power to support four or five of the inferior sex
    heaped anyhow on a chair. Such a woman is a crown to a
    husband&mdash;nay, any amount of crowns at £200 per
    week&mdash;and capable of supporting a family, however large,
    all by her own exertions, or indeed, with scarcely any exertion
    at all. At present, though married, she is a <i>femme
    seule</i>: but how long will she remain the only electric
    wonder in London? Many years ago there was a one-legged dancer
    named DONATO. Within sixteen weeks there were as many
    one-legged dancers. We don't speak by the card, of course, but
    one-legged dancers became a drug in the market. Already we hear
    of "A Dynamic Phenomenon" at the Pavilion. Little Mrs. ABBOTT
    is an active, spry little person, yet her "<i>vis inertiæ</i>"
    is, at present, without a parallel.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podbury.</i> Well, old chap, your resigning like that has
    made all the difference to <i>me</i>, I can tell you!</p>

    <p><i>Culchard.</i> If I have succeeded in advancing your cause
    with Miss PRENDERGAST, I am all the better pleased, of
    course.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> You have, and no mistake. She's regularly taken
    me in hand, don't you know&mdash;she says I've no intelligent
    appreciation of Italian Art; and gad, I believe she's right
    there! But I'm pulling up&mdash;bound to teach you a lot,
    seeing all the old altar-pieces I do! And she gives me the
    right tips, don't you see; she's no end of a clever girl, so
    well-read and all that! But I say&mdash;about Miss TROTTER?
    Don't want to be inquisitive, you know, but you don't seem to
    be much <i>about</i> with her.</p>

        </a>"Bound to teach you a lot, seeing all the old
        altar-pieces I do!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I&mdash;er&mdash;the feelings I entertain
    towards Miss TROTTER have suffered no change&mdash;quite the
    reverse, only&mdash;and I wish to impress this upon you,
    PODBURY&mdash;it is undesirable, for&mdash;er&mdash;many
    reasons, to make my attentions&mdash;er&mdash;too conspicuous.
    I&mdash;I trust you have not alluded to the matter
    to&mdash;well, to Miss PRENDERGAST, for example?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Not I, old fellow&mdash;got other things to
    talk about. But I don't quite see why&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You are not <i>required</i> to see. I don't
    <i>wish</i> it, that is all. I&mdash;er&mdash;think that should
    be sufficient.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, all right, <i>I'll</i> keep dark. But she's
    bound to know sooner or later, now she and Miss TROTTER have
    struck up such a friendship. And HYPATIA will be awfully
    pleased about it&mdash;why <i>shouldn't</i> she, you know?...
    I'm going to see if there's anyone on the tennis-court, and get
    a game if I can. Ta-ta!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>alone</i>). PODBURY knows very little
    about women. If HYP&mdash;Miss PRENDERGAST&mdash;once found out
    <i>why</i> I renounced my suitorship, I should have very little
    peace, I know that&mdash;I've taken particular care not to
    betray my attachment to MAUD. I'm afraid she's beginning to
    notice it, but I must be careful. I don't like this sudden
    intimacy between them&mdash;it makes things so very awkward.
    They've been sitting under that tree over there for the last
    half-hour, and goodness only knows what confidences they may
    have exchanged! I really must go up and put a stop to it,
    presently.</p>

    <h4><i>Under the Tree.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Hypatia.</i> I only tell you all this, sweetest one,
    because I <i>do</i> think you have rather too low an opinion of
    men as a class, and I wanted to show you that I have met at
    least <i>one</i> man who was capable of a real and
    disinterested devotion.</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Well, I allowed that was about your idea.</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> And don't you recognise that it was very fine of
    him to give up everything for his friend's sake?</p>

    <p><i>Maud</i>. I guess it depends how much "everything"
    amounted to.</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). I thought, darling, I had made
    it perfectly plain what a sacrifice it meant to him. <i>I</i>
    know how much he&mdash;I needn't tell you there are certain
    symptoms one can<i>not</i> be deceived in.</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> No, I guess you needn't tell me <i>that</i>,
    love. And it was perfectly lovely of him to give you up, when
    he was under vow for you and all, sooner than stand in his
    friend's light&mdash;only I don't just see how that was going
    to help his friend any.</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> Don't you, dearest? Not when the friend was
    under vow for me, too?</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Well, HYPATIA PRENDERGAST! And how many
    admirers do you have around under vow, as a regular thing?</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> There were only those two. RUSKIN permits as
    many as seven at one time.</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> That's a vurry liberal allowance, too. I don't
    see how there'd be sufficient suitors to go round. But maybe
    each gentleman can be under vow for seven distinct girls, to
    make things sort of square now?</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> Certainly not. The whole beauty of the idea lies
    in the unselfish and exclusive devotion of every knight to the
    same sovereign lady. In this case I happen to know that
    the&mdash;a&mdash;individual had never met his ideal
    until&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Until he met you? At Nuremberg, wasn't it? My!
    And what was his name? Do tell!</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> You must not press me, sweetest, for I cannot
    tell that&mdash;even to you.</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> I don't believe but what I could guess. But
    say, you didn't care any for <i>him</i>, or you'd never have
    let him go like that? <i>I</i> wouldn't. I should have
    suspected there was something behind!</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> My feelings towards him were purely potential. I
    did him the simple justice to believe that his self-abnegation
    was sincere. But, with your practical, cynical little mind,
    darling, you are hardly capable of&mdash;excuse me for saying
    so&mdash;of appreciating the real value and meaning of such
    magnanimity!</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Oh, I guess I <i>am</i>, though. Why, here's
    Mr. CULCHARD coming along. Well, Mr. CULCHARD?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I&mdash;ah&mdash;appear to have interrupted a
    highly interesting conversation?</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Well, we were having a little discussion, and I
    guess you're in time to give the casting vote&mdash;HYPATIA,
    you want to keep just where you are, do you hear? I mean you
    should listen to Mr. CULCHARD's opinion.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>flattered</i>). Which I shall be delighted
    to give, if you will put me in possession of
    the&mdash;er&mdash;facts.</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Well, these are the&mdash;er&mdash;facts. There
    were two gentlemen under vow&mdash;maybe you'll understand the
    working of that arrangement better than I do?&mdash;under vow
    for the same young lady. [HYPATIA PRENDERGAST, sit still, or I
    declare I'll pinch you!] One of them comes up and tells her
    that he's arrived at the conclusion the other admirer is the
    better man, and, being a friend of his, he ought to retire in
    his favour, and he does it, too, right away. Now <i>I</i> say
    that isn't natural&mdash;he'd some other motive. Miss
    PRENDERGAST here will have it he was one of those noble
    unselfish natures that deserve they should be stuffed for a
    museum. What's <i>your</i> opinion now?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>perspiring freely</i>).
    Why&mdash;er&mdash;really, on so delicate a matter,
    I&mdash;I&mdash; [<i>He maunders.</i></p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> MAUD, why <i>will</i> you be so headstrong!
    (<i>In a rapid whisper.</i>) Can't you see ... can't you
    <i>guess</i>?...</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> I guess I want to make sure Mr. CULCHARD isn't
    that kind of magnanimous man himself. I shouldn't want him to
    renounce <i>me</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> MAUD! You might at <i>least</i> wait until Mr.
    CULCHARD has&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Oh, but he <i>did</i>&mdash;weeks ago, at
    Bingen. And at Lugano, too, the other day, he spoke out
    tolerable plain. I guess he didn't wish any secret made about
    it&mdash;<i>did</i> you, Mr. CULCHARD?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I&mdash;ah&mdash;this conversation is rather
    ... If you'll excuse me&mdash; [<i>Escapes with as much dignity
    as he can command.</i></p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Well, my dear,&mdash;that's the sort of
    self-denying hairpin <i>he</i> is! What do you think of him
    <i>now</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> I do not think so highly of him, I confess. His
    renunciation was evidently less prompted by consideration for
    his friend than by a recollection&mdash;tardy enough, I am
    afraid&mdash;of the duty which bound him to <i>you</i>,
    dearest. But if you had seen and heard him, as I did, you would
    not have doubted the <i>reality</i> of the sacrifice, whatever
    the true reason may have been. For myself, I am conscious of
    neither anger nor sorrow&mdash;my heart, as I told you, was
    never really affected. But what must it be to <i>you</i>,
    darling!</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> Well, I believe I'm more amused than
    anything.</p>

    <p><i>Hyp.</i> Amused! But surely you don't mean to have
    anything more to do with him?</p>

    <p><i>Maud.</i> My dear girl, I intend to have considerable
    more to do with him before I'm through. He's under vow for
    <i>me</i> now, anyway, and I don't mean he should forget it,
    either. He's my monkey, and he's got to jump around pretty
    lively, at the end of a tolerable short chain, too. And I
    guess, if it comes to renouncing, all the magnanimity's going
    to be on <i>my</i> side this
    time!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"
       id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>

    <h4><i>In an Avenue.</i></h4>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself, as he walks hurriedly on</i>).
    I only saved myself in time. I don't <i>think</i> MAUD noticed
    anything&mdash;she couldn't nave been so innocent and
    indifferent if she had.... And HYPATIA won't enlighten her any
    further now&mdash;after what she knows. It's rather a relief
    that she <i>does</i> know.... She took it very well, poor
    girl&mdash;<i>very</i> well. I expect she is really beginning
    to put up with PODBURY&mdash;I'm sure I <i>hope</i> so,
    sincerely!</p>

    <p>"I dearly love reading a ghost-story," quoth the Baron,
    "when, as the song says, 'The lights are low, And the
    flickering shadows, Softly come and go.' And I did hope that
    <i>Cecilia de Noël</i> was going to be just the very sort of
    book for a winter's fireside. Disappointed. There is a ghost in
    it, and there's <i>Cecilia de Noël</i> (good Christmassy name,
    isn't it?) who instructs the ghost in his neglected Catechism;
    for the ghost is as much an Atheist as the unbelieving Sadducee
    in this same story, who, after all, is not converted. 'Alas!
    Poor Ghost!' Very poor ghost! Bring me another ghost!" cries
    the Baron. No other ghost is forthcoming to the invocation, but
    a book is placed in his hands entitled <i>Fourteen to One</i>.
    The Baron was about to dismiss it as a betting
    book&mdash;judging by its title&mdash;when his eye caught the
    name of ELIZABETH STUART PHELPS as authoress. So he read many
    of the short stories therein. She has in many places the touch
    of DICKENS. All are good; but for pathos, keen observation, and
    dramatic surprise, "give me," says the Baron, emphatically,
    "the short story of <i>The Madonna of the Tubs</i>." Admirable!
    Those who take and act upon the Baron's tip, will do well to
    ask for <i>Fourteen to One</i>, and see that they get it.</p>

    <p>What are the Baron's sentiments as to Christmas things? He
    refused to have anything to say to games and cards.
    Cards&mdash;well, we all know whose books some puritanical
    party said <i>they</i> were. But these comic and artistic
    Christmas Cards of RAPHAEL TUCK do not come into that category;
    and same is to be said of Messrs. HILDESHEIMER's, so there's an
    end on't. Henceforth, says the Baron, "No Cards."</p>

    <p>"Come to me, O ye children," as some one sings&mdash;ARTHUR
    CECIL for choice&mdash;and it might be adapted for the occasion
    by the Publishers of <i>Chatterbox</i>, in which box there's a
    prize. Messrs. ROUTLEDGE go in for the old, old tales. They've
    kindly given <i>Mother Hubbard</i> a new dress; and as for
    their Panorama of the "Beasteses," it is like a picture-walk in
    the Zoo. <i>Some Historic Women</i>, well selected by DAVENPORT
    ADAMS, who should have styled it <i>Christmas Eves by
    Adams</i>. With Mrs. MOLESWORTH's <i>Bewitched Lamp</i> the
    Baron's Assistant is much pleased. Pictures ought to have been
    in oil, and there should have been a Wickéd Fairy in
    it,&mdash;but there isn't.</p>

    <p>My "Co." reports that Mrs. GRIMWOOD's long-expected book,
    <i>My Three Years in Manipur</i> (BENTLEY), is worthy of the
    theme, and adds a fresh laurel to the chaplet worn by the lady
    on whose breast the QUEEN pinned the Red Cross. The moving
    story is told with a simplicity that looks like the development
    of the highest art. But the heroine of Manipur is unmistakably
    artless. She is content to jot down, as if she were writing a
    letter home, her impressions of what she sees, and her account
    of what passes before her eyes. She has the gift of reproducing
    with a few strokes of the pen, portraiture of anything that has
    struck her. The only thing missed is detailed report of her own
    brave bearing through the fearful night when the Residency was
    attacked, and during the dreadful days that followed on the
    flight towards Cachar. No one reading Mrs. GRIMWOOD's narrative
    would guess what splendid part she played in that tragedy.
    Fortunately that has been told elsewhere, and the omission is
    an added charm to a book that has many others&mdash;including a
    portrait of the author.</p>

    <h2>CIVIL SERVICE EXHIBITION.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;The Military Exhibition was such a
    success, and the Naval Exhibition was such a successor, that we
    Government Clerks invoke your powerful aid to help us to
    establish next year a Civil Service Exhibition. The Public have
    really no idea what wondrous curiosities there are in the Civil
    Service, and would, I feel sure, be amused and instructed at a
    well-organised and representative Exhibition. At 10.15 A.M.
    they would see real live Clerks sign real Attendance-Books, and
    insert (real or unreal) times of arrival. In the course of the
    morning there might be an Exhibition of Civil Servants over
    sixty-five years of age, who didn't want to retire, with a
    similar number of Civil Servants, of fifty-five years of age,
    who didn't want them to stay. In the afternoon, in the Arena,
    would daily be attempted the difficult feat of proceeding from
    the Second Division to the Higher Division. The obstacles would
    be represented by real Treasury Clerks and Civil Service
    Commissioners, holding Orders in Council and Treasury Minutes;
    and the Clerk successful in performing the feat might be
    created a Duke.</p>

    <p>In one of the kiosks a lecture on <i>"Sick Leave and how to
    spend it," by the Earl and the Doctor</i>, might be delivered
    hourly. In another kiosk, official C.B.'s would be on show;
    Jubilee C.B.'s being classed together on one side, and special
    prominence being given to those C.B.'s who hadn't applied for
    the honour, and to those who had obtained it for real services
    otherwise unrecognised. After dark the "Treasury Ring" might

    <p>It seems impossible to support a Royal English Opera House
    with its special commodity of English Opera, that is, Opera
    composed by an Englishman to an Englishman's <i>libretto</i>,
    and played by English operatic singers. <i>Ivanhoe</i>, a
    genuine English Opera, by a genuine English Composer (with an
    Irish name), produced with great <i>éclat</i>, has, after a
    fair run and lots of favour, been <i>Doyl-écarté</i>, in order
    to make room for the <i>Basoche</i>, an essentially French
    Opera, by French Composer and Librettists, done, of course,
    into English, so as to be "understanded of the people." The
    <i>Basoche</i> has "caught on," and our friends in front,
    including Composer, Librettist, and
    Middlemen&mdash;DRURIOLANUS, who bought it, and DOYLY CARTY,
    who bought it of Sir DRURI&mdash;are all equally pleased and
    satisfied. Considered as a matter of business, what signifies
    the nationality as long as the spec pays?&mdash;<i>tout est
    là.</i> Only why retain the differentiating title of "English"
    for the establishment? Why not call it "The Cosmopolitan Opera
    House"? Of course this applies, nowadays, to Covent Garden
    Theatre, which is no longer the Italian Opera House, but simply
    the Covent Garden Opera during the Operatic Season, when
    French, English, Italian, and German Operas are played by a
    Babel of singers. By the way, while on the subject of
    nomenclature, why not "The Royal Babel Opera House"?</p>

    <h2>OUR FINANCIAL COLUMN.</h2>

    <p>I have been forced by the enormous increase of my business
    to take larger offices, and to engage two hundred additional
    clerks to carry on my immense correspondence. I merely mention
    this as it may be satisfactory to my countless well-wishers.
    But of course the old address&mdash;"CROESUS: London" will
    still find me. I publish below a selection from the letters
    received during the week.</p>

    <p>(1.) SIR,&mdash;You informed me in a private communication,
    that the Patent Spills Manufacturing Co. stock was a splendid
    investment. Acting on this, I bought. From that moment, Spills
    have fallen steadily. Kindly explain.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours,<br />
    INDIGNANT.</p>

    <p>[To this I can only answer, that the complaint is ludicrous,
    and preposterous. If you had bought on the day I advised, and
    sold out ten minutes afterwards, you would have realised a
    handsome profit of one farthing a share. Moreover, how can
    anything fall steadily? I never did, which shows what a fool
    "INDIGNANT" must be.</p>

    <p class="author">CROESUS.]</p>

    <p>(2.) SIR,&mdash;I send £22,000 19<i>s.</i> 8-3/4<i>d.</i>,
    which I wish tied up as tightly as possible in the Unlimited
    Packthread Stock Company, which you say is as safe as a house.
    Let me know which particular house you mean. The money belongs
    (or belonged) to my Maiden Aunt.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours sincerely,<br />
    BALIK RASH.</p>

    <p>[Consider it done, my dear Sir; consider it done. I return
    the three farthings, for which I have no possible use. The rest
    is invested. Transfers await your signature at my new
    office.</p>

    <p class="author">CROESUS.]</p>

    <p>(3.) SIR,&mdash;I have saved £4 5<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> during
    the last twenty years, and now send it to you in the Automatic
    Toast and Muffin Distributor Co., which I see guarantees a
    return of 500 per cent., with an anticipated increase of 200
    per cent. from the sale of concessions in suburban districts.
    "The Muffins," you say, "will always be kept at toasting point,
    and, by a novel and ingenious arrangement, a perpetual supply
    of the best butter will spread itself over every Muffin as it
    is distributed to the Public." I like this very much. Pray,
    therefore, place me on toast to the enclosed amount.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours,<br />
    ONE IN THE SLOT.</p>

    <p>[Have done what you wish. You have already cleared profit of
    over £500. We shall add buns and crumpets to our business
    to-morrow, and tea-cakes on the following day, so as to place
    it in everybody's power to take the cake, if he wants to.</p>

    <p class="author">CROESUS.]</p>

    <p>I have little more to add this week, but I think it only
    right to hint that I am engaged in perfecting the details of a
    scheme which will revolutionise finance. I am not allowed,
    <i>at present</i>, to enter into full particulars, but I may
    say that I have been in close conference with the very highest
    person in the world of finance, and that he is to submit my
    plan to the next Cabinet Council. Briefly, when my scheme is
    floated, Consols will immediately go to par, and will be
    converted into a security bearing ten per cent.
    interest&mdash;and this without a single penny being added to
    the tax-payers' burdens. I have been authorised by the
    officials of the Treasury to receive any investments that my
    readers may offer. Now, therefore, is your time. Next week I
    may have to take a short holiday, owing to the strain on my
    nerves, caused by my numerous anxieties. But the good work will
    go on as before.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> I hope so, too. My idea is to give the
    children of the poor every possible advantage. Let them learn
    all they can. Yes, Sir, let them learn all they can.</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>excitedly</i>). But, my dear Sir,
    what can be the good of that? It will be of no use to them in
    their future, and will only make them dissatisfied with their
    position.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>calmly</i>). Ah, my dear Sir, you
    evidently take a narrow view of the subject. Why should not the
    poor enjoy equality with the rich? It is only the accident of
    birth that divides the peasant from the Peer.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>obstinately</i>). I do not care
    about the cause, I only look to the result&mdash;the rich
    <i>are</i> divided from the poor. It is ridiculous that an
    orange-girl should play the piano, and a ploughman paint a
    picture.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). I do not see why.
    Surely the poor should have their little amusements? And do we
    not have it on decent classical authority, "that Art polishes
    the manners, and renders them less ferocious!"</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Ah! You take a
    sentimental view of it! Believe me, the people would be all the
    better were they to receive a practical&mdash;a technical
    education&mdash;say were they to be taught how to sweep
    chimneys, or to blacken boots!</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>complacently</i>). They will engage
    in both those useful industries with the greater <i>gusto</i>
    if they know that when they are at leisure they can understand
    MACAULAY or enjoy BEETHOVEN.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>with conviction</i>). But you must
    admit that there is a good deal of waste. Consider Mr. FORSTER
    calculated that the rate would be threepence in the pound, and
    now it's a shilling, and will go higher still! Remember that
    Londoners pay far more dearly than citizens of many provincial
    towns, for an article not one whit better.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>with, a genial smile</i>). Ah, I see
    you are quoting from the Press.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>earnestly</i>). And why not? Is it
    true, or is it not, that money is squandered upon rotten
    buildings, upon excessive salaries to teachers, and upon the
    provision of refinements in education?</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Still quoting! But if I
    admit that there is something in what you say, is it not always
    the case? Have we ever unmixed good, or unmixed evil? And I
    contend that the same advantages derivable from a School-Board
    education entirely compensate for a little loss.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>rather out of temper</i>). Well, you
    take it calmly enough.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>amiably</i>). Why not? It is my
    theory that every child should have the best possible
    education. The infant should have enough mental food to last
    him for life. It is our duty that he should got it.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>with irritation</i>). Well, at least
    you take an unselfish view of the case.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>smiling sweetly</i>). I don't see
    that! As a matter of fact, I am sufficiently successful not to
    care for competition. I believe that I am first-rate in my own
    walk; and, however the School Board may educate, they will not
    reach my standard.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>drily</i>). I was not thinking of
    that, although it is a consideration. But how about the rates,
    my dear Sir&mdash;the rates?</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>with a good-humoured laugh</i>). Oh,
    bother the rates! I don't see where they come in.</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>with ghastly jocularity</i>). But I
    do&mdash;by the front door.</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>condescendingly</i>). Tut, tut! But
    what have the rates to do with the matter?</p>

    <p><i>Second Pass.</i> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, at a shilling
    in the pound and more to follow, you must admit they make a
    hole in a modest income?</p>

    <p><i>First Pass.</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). And what if
    they do, Sir&mdash;what if they do? Have we no duty to our
    fellow man? Ought we not to sacrifice something on his
    behalf&mdash;for his sake? And, my dear Sir, I speak all the
    more dispassionately, because my rates are paid&mdash;<i>by my
    Landlord!</i> [<i>Curtain.</i></p>

    <p><i>Scandal Hall, Torking</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>ONLY FANCY!</h2>

    <p>We find the following paragraph in a
    contemporary:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A meeting on the Somersetshire floods has been summoned
        by the Earl of CORK, Lord-Lieutenant of the County, for
        to-morrow, at Bridgewater.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We are bound to observe that this arrangement displays a
    lamentable lack of consideration for others on the part of the
    noble convener. It is all very well for the Earl of CORK to
    select the Somersetshire floods for a place of meeting. But
    whilst CORK is bobbing up and down, buoyantly enjoying himself,
    what is to become of ordinary persons foregathered in such
    circumstances? We presume that boats, or at least life-belts,
    will be provided for the movers and seconders of the various
    resolutions. Or does Bridgewater cover everything?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Walking down St. James' Street the other day, whom should we
    meet but the Earl of PORTSMOUTH, long known in the House of
    Commons as Lord LYMINGTON. Opportunity was taken to inquire
    whether a recent event in South Molton had led to any
    estrangement between his Lordship and his former
    constituents.</p>

    <p>"No, TOBY," said the belted Earl; "I think I may say, that,
    between me and my old constituents, the wing of friendship has
    not Molton a feather."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In the foregoing paragraph, the phrase "belted Earl," is
    used advisedly. At the period of which Sir WALTER SCOTT wrote
    (<i>vide</i> any of his novels) it will be found that members
    of this rank of the Peerage are all spoken of as belted. For
    some time the fashion fell out of use. The belt was
    appropriately revived by the late Earl of BEACONSFIELD, and is
    now quite a common thing with the aristocracy. The Earl of
    SELBORNE is very particular about the fit and cut of his.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. BOYCE, in his interesting and picturesque work,
    <i>Snowdon and Rained Upon</i>, insists on the desirability of
    taking only a light luncheon when engaged upon a pedestrian
    tour. He adds, "I walked up Snowdon on two hard-boiled eggs."
    The remark seems scarcely relevant, but it records a notable
    achievement. Considering the height of Snowdon, and the
    occasional stoniness of the path, to walk up it on two eggs,
    howsoever hard-boiled, is a feat that puts in the shade the
    Music-hall trick of riding up an inclined plane of rope on a
    bicycle. Mr. BOYCE does not say what he came down upon.
    Probably his back.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We hear from Munich that underneath the motto, <i>Suprema
    lex regis voluntas</i>, written in the Visitors' Book by the
    Emperor of GERMANY, there now appears the following
    line&mdash;<i>Rex est major singulis, minor universis</i>. Herr
    HITHERCLIFT, the well-known German authority, having made a
    careful examination of the page, states his opinion that the
    handwriting is that of Prince BISMARCK, or is an excellent
    imitation.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>A WARLIKE TALE FROM THE PACIFIC.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Fragment from the Possible Diary of a Realistic
    Novelist.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Well, now I think I have got matters pretty straight. The
    question is, whether the Baron will accept my last message as
    chaff, or resent it. Let me see, how does it read&mdash;"It is
    suggested, for the President's consideration, that rumours
    uncorrected or unexplained acquire almost the force of admitted
    truth." Quite so&mdash;so they do. Let me see&mdash;"That any
    want of confidence between the governed and the Government must
    be hurtful"&mdash;well, to us both. Yes! That's all right. So
    it will! Lastly, "That the rumours, in their present form, tend
    to damage the white races in the native mind, and to influence
    for the worse the manners of the Samoans." Now, that
    <i>ought</i> to fetch him! A wink is as good as a nod to a
    blind pig! However, he is quite ass enough to do nothing!
    Everybody saying that he is going to blow us all up, himself
    included! Why it's enough to make the natives rise and kill
    every white man in the place. Still, good idea for a story.</p>

    <p><i>Later</i>. The idiot! Instead of promptly denying the
    facts, he says he won't have anything to do with us, because
    "we care so little for the correctness of the facts we deal
    with." We only asked for information. Are we going to be blown
    into smithereens, or are we not? That's the point, and he won't
    tell us! Wants to know what business it is of ours? The
    situation is decidedly dramatic&mdash;but unpleasant!</p>

    <p><i>Later Still</i>.&mdash;Have replied that "the matter very
    much concerns us." Tell him, we wrote, not for protection, but
    for information. "Are we going to be blown up, or are we not?"
    An answer will oblige.</p>

    <p><i>A Little Later</i>.&mdash;No, he is not to be drawn.
    Won't swerve an inch. So now we are trying another dodge. Will
    he resign his dual office? He says he will resign one. But he
    knows that won't do. If he remains chief adviser to the King,
    we shall be nowhere. His last idea is to resign the
    Presidentship of the Municipal Council. Why, we are the
    Council, and we should have kicked him out if he hadn't! Very
    funny, but it's hard to laugh when one's within an ace of a
    massacre or an explosion.</p>

    <p><i>Latest</i>.&mdash;Still in doubt. However, have a subject
    for something in the dramatic line. What the entertainment will
    be, depends upon the future development of the plot. At present
    it may turn out a Tragedy&mdash;or an <i>Opéra-bouffe</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>NOTICE.&mdash;Rejected Communications or Contributions,
    whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any
    description, will in no case be returned, not even when
    accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or
    Wrapper. To this rule there will be no exception.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
